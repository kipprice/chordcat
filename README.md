# Achord / ChordCat
Achord is intended to serve as a happy medium between full music notation and plain guitar tab. It allows you to build a chord library, add chords from that library to a set of phrases, and add lyrics.

This project stemmed from my own need for a quick way to jot down chords that I was thinking about for a song, complete with strumming patterns.

## Planned Features
- Select chords through either an interactive fretboard or a chord selector.
- Algorithms to optimize where to play chords for all chords in the library
- Add chords to phrases
- Add lyrics to a phrase
- Add phrases to a song
- Playback your song
- Print your song
- Save and load locally

## Potential features
- Get realistic sounding instruments
- Use midi input to generate the song file
- Use microphone input to generate the song
- Saving and loading in the cloud
- Membership
- Write a melody line for lyrics
